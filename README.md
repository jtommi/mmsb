# Intro

This repository contains different modules and schematics.

## Modules

### [AS3340](AS3340) (not tested)

This is a simple 1V/oct VCO using the AS3340/CEM3340 chip.
Based mostly on [Look Mum No cumpter's project](https://www.lookmumnocomputer.com/projects/#/cem-3340-diy-simple)

I added some things from the AS3340 datasheet.

### [LMNC Attack Release 2.0](LMNC%20Attack%20Release%202.0) (not tested)

A simple envelope generator with Attack and Release or Decay
Schematic drawn from [Look Mum No cumpter's stripboard layout](https://www.lookmumnocomputer.com/projects#/simple-envelope-generator)

### [LMNC Dual VCA](LMNC%20Dual%20VCA) (not tested)

A dual VCA using the AS3360 chip.
Schematic mostly drawn from [Look Mum No cumpter's schematic](https://www.lookmumnocomputer.com/projects#/1181-dual-vca)
